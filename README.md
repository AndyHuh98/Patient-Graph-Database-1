## patients-database
This is the first of two graph databases and graph database applications that I've created. This one is more of a rough draft for the upcoming graph database that utilizes MIT's MIMIC III demo database. The main code is located in the neo4j/main folder.

The Patient Database uses Neo4J and has two functions - the first creates a sample graph database using Neo4J's embedded Java library. Then, after creating the graph database, it opens a Java application that allows users to easily query the graph database.

Graph Database 2 will optimize the connections between data points (and utilize far more data) than this first graph database, as well as provide a cleaner and even easier way to query the data.
